1. Change the author to your name, or you and the friend with whom you are working.
2. Rename this file with your student ID (for easy grading)
3. Complete the two tasks below and push the Rmd back to Github.


## Functions.

There are the beginnings of two functions below. The first one should generate data from a linear model. The second
should estimate the linear model from your data, and then make some plots to view your data.

```{r functions}
generate.data <- function(n){
  X = matrix(rnorm(2*n), n, 2)
  epsilon = rnorm(n)
  beta = runif(3, -1, 1) 
  y = # how do you get y?
  df = data.frame(y=y, X1 = X[,1], X2 = X[,2])
  ret = list(dat=df, beta=beta)
  return(ret)
}

estimate.and.plot <- function(data, ...){
  mdl = lm(y~X1+X2, data=data)
  resids = # how do you get residuals?
  fit = # how do you get the fitted values?
  par(mfrow=c(2,2))
  plot(y~fit,...)
  plot(resids~X1,...)
  plot(resids~X2,...)
  qqnorm(resids, pch=19, bty='n',las=1)
  qqline(resids)
  return(mdl)
}
```
